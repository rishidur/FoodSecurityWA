# FoodSecurityWA

This is an unfinished app centered around food security that helps identify how old food is. The innovative approach uses machine learning techniques to enhance user experience, making it a valuable tool for individuals and families. I utilized React.js and the Pixels library, showcasing my ability to develop applications without relying on TensorFlow. The project is a testament to my skills in front-end development and my passion for addressing food security challenges.

## Future Implementations

The potential future developments for this app are exciting and can significantly enhance its functionality:

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Once fully implemented, the app will leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze food characteristics and predict freshness.
  
- **User Feedback Loop**: Incorporating a feedback mechanism to improve predictions over time based on user input.

- **Mobile Compatibility**: Expanding the app for mobile devices to increase accessibility and usability.

- **Nutritional Information**: Adding features to provide users with nutritional insights based on the food's age and condition.

- **Community Features**: Creating a platform for users to share their experiences and tips related to food preservation and security.

With these features, FoodSecurityWA aims to empower users to make informed decisions about their food, contributing to greater food security in their communities. 

## Conclusion
While still in its early stages, FoodSecurityWA has the potential to make a significant impact on food security and consumer awareness. As you continue to develop this project, the incorporation of machine learning techniques will enhance its functionality and effectiveness, leading to a more comprehensive solution for identifying food freshness.
